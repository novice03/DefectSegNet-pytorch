# DefectSegNet-pytorch
An unofficial PyTorch implementation of DefectSegNet in PyTorch

DefectSegNet is a steel defect detection model introducted in the paper [Deep Learning for Semantic Segmentation of Defects in Advanced STEM Images of Steels](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49105-0). The [implementation by the paper's authors](https://github.com/rajatsainju/DefectSegNet) is written in tensorflow and keras. This is an unofficial implementation written in PyTorch. DefectSegNet.py consists of only the model architecture. This repository does not contain the pre-trained weights of the model. Any issues can be adressed through a pull request.
